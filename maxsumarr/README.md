Given an array `x` of length `n >= 0`, write a function that returns two numbers which when added
together gives the maximum possible sum of the elements in the array.

### For Example:
1. `{1, 4, 6, 2, 10}` returns `6` and `10`. Because 6 and 10 and the two largest numbers in the
array, their sum will be the maximum possible sum.
2. `{}` returns `NULL`. Because the array is empty.
Notes:
Your expected time complexity is either `n` or `nlogn`
